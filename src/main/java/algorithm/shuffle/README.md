Fisher-Yates Shuffle / Knuth Shuffle
---------------------
It is an algorithm for generating a random permutation of a finite set—in plain terms, for randomly shuffling the set. 

**Fisher–Yates / Knuth ** shuffling is similar to randomly picking numbered tickets (combinatorics: distinguishable objects) out of a hat without replacement until there are none left.

It's **Optimal**, meaning it is O(n)
