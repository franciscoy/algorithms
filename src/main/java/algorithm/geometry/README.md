Closest Pair of Points (Naive)
---------------------
The closest pair of points problem or closest pair problem is a problem of computational geometry: given n points in metric space, find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them. 
It's implemented naivley, such as for each point the distance to all the rest is checked, **n * n**.
**There is a better approach with the divide and conquer algorithm.**
